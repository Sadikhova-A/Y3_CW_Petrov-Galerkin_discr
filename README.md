# Scientific Computation Coursework
Computational application of the Finite Element Method, particularly Petrov-Galerkin discredisation.
- Solved a general first-order problem with Petrov-Galerkin (PG) disctretization by bilulding matrix and vector generating functions
- Solved a general second-order problem with PG
- Built a funtion that outputs approximate solutions to the heat equation using the Backwards Euler Method and Galerkin Finite Element Method
- Added doc_stings
- The code is throughly commented as required
